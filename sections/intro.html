                <h2>1. Introduction to Microservices</h2>
                <p class="lead">A deep dive into the microservices architectural style.</p>

                <h4>From Monolith to Microservices</h4>
                <p>The industry has seen a major shift from monolithic architectures to microservices. A <strong>monolith</strong> is a single, unified application containing all functionality. While simple to develop and deploy initially, monoliths become difficult to scale, maintain, and update as they grow in complexity. A bug in one module can bring down the entire application, and a single technology stack limits flexibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Microservices</strong>, on the other hand, structure an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability, has its own codebase, and can be deployed and scaled independently. This approach offers greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.</p>

                <h4>Implementation with Java & Spring Boot</h4>
                <p>Spring Boot is the de-facto standard for building microservices in the Java ecosystem. It simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can "just run".</p>
                <p>Here's a simple "Hello, World" microservice with Spring Boot:</p>
                <pre><code>
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class HelloWorldApplication {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Microservices!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloWorldApplication.class, args);
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>This code creates a simple REST endpoint that returns "Hello, Microservices!". You can run this as a standalone Java application.</p>

                <h4>Real-World Use Case: E-commerce Platform</h4>
                <p>Consider an e-commerce platform. In a monolithic approach, the entire application (product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, payments, etc.) is a single unit. With microservices, you would have separate services for each of these functionalities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product Catalog Service:</strong> Manages product information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shopping Cart Service:</strong> Manages users' shopping carts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Order Service:</strong> Handles order creation and processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Service:</strong> Processes payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Service:</strong> Manages user accounts and authentication.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This separation allows the e-commerce platform to scale each service independently. For example, during a flash sale, the shopping cart and payment services can be scaled up to handle the increased load, without affecting other services.</p>

                <h4>Real-World Examples</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Netflix:</strong> One of the most famous examples of a large-scale microservices architecture. They moved from a monolith to over 700 microservices to achieve high availability and resilience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon's retail website is powered by thousands of microservices, each responsible for a small piece of functionality on the page (e.g., the "buy" button, recommendations, reviews).</li>
                </ul>
